Running SQL Server and antivirus software on the same machine requires careful configuration to ensure optimal performance and security. Here are the recommendations regarding antivirus exclusions for SQL Server:

1. File Extensions to Exclude:

* .mdf - Primary database file
* .ndf - Secondary database file
* .ldf - Log file

2. Directories to Exclude:

* Database files location: The directory where your database files (.mdf, .ndf, .ldf) are stored.
* Backup files location: The directory where your SQL Server backup files are stored.
* SQL Server program files: Typically located in directories like C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server.
* Temporary data files: The directory for SQL Server's temporary files (often C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.xx\MSSQL\DATA\ or similar).

3. Processes to Exclude:

* sqlservr.exe - The SQL Server service executable.
* sqlagent.exe - The SQL Server Agent service executable.

4. Network Exclusions:

* Ensure antivirus software does not interfere with SQL Server network traffic. Exclude SQL Server network ports (default is 1433 for TCP/IP) from real-time scanning.

5. Backup and Restore Operations:

* Ensure antivirus software is not scanning or blocking backup or restore operations, as these can be intensive and time-sensitive.

6. Transaction Logs:

* Exclude transaction log directories, as scanning these can severely impact performance.

7. Temporary Directories:

* Any temporary directories used by SQL Server (like those used by Integration Services or Analysis Services).

8. Database Management Files:

* Any directories used by SQL Server for replication or other database management operations.
