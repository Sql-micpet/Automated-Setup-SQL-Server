Ensuring Backup Volumes Are Included in the Central Backup Schema When running backups in SQL Server using SQL Agent and backing up to disk, it is crucial to ensure that the volume you backup to is included in the backup schema of the central backup solution. This ensures that your backups are safeguarded for long-term storage and eliminates a single point of failure. By integrating the backup volume into the central backup solution, you guarantee that your data is protected and reliably stored, enhancing overall data security and integrity.
